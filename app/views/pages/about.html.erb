<h1 align="center">About Team Memholes</h1>



<p>There are a lot of potholes in Memphis, and in a city that has a strong sense of community, we should have a way to not only list and track the potholes. The idea is simple. Letâ€™s build a website that has a map layout of the city of Memphis. On this map are pins designated to the specific place that people have identified potholes. On this website, a user can add additional potholes.</p>
